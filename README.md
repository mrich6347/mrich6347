# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt

## ðŸš€ About Me

Full Stack Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable applications and solving complex problems. I love playing around with the latest technologies and exploring different AI tools.

## ðŸ’» Current Side Project

I am currently building out budgeting software that closely resembles the popular YNAB (You need a budget), but with even more features I have been wanting for a long time. With the bonus of no longer having to pay $17 a month!
